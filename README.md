## 🎯 The Problem

Current city energy dashboards present data in ways that are:

- **Unreadable**: Technical units like kWh and Megajoules are meaningless to average citizens
- **Uninspiring**: Static spreadsheets and charts fail to motivate behavioral change
- **Disconnected**: People don't see how their individual actions impact city-wide goals

## 💡 Our Solution

City Pulse bridges this gap through three innovative views:

### 1. **Policymaker View (Old Way)**

A deliberately dated interface showing how traditional reporting systems present data—complex tables, technical jargon, and disconnected metrics that fail to inspire action.

### 2. **Citizen View (Live Dashboard)**

A real-time, gamified experience featuring:

- **Persona-based experiences** (Student, Family, Business) with tailored metrics
- **Real-world impact translation** (trees planted equivalent, money saved)
- **Interactive controls** (thermostat slider with instant feedback)
- **Rewards marketplace** (unlock local perks by saving energy)
- **District heatmap** (see neighborhood engagement in real-time)
- **Live energy mix visualization** (renewable vs. fossil fuel usage)

### 3. **2030 Vision (Simulation)**

An interactive projection tool that lets users:

- Adjust citizen engagement levels
- Visualize impact on Helsinki's 2030 carbon neutrality goals
- See how behavioral changes accelerate climate targets

## 📊 Data Model

### Personas

Each persona has unique characteristics:

```javascript
{
  multiplier: number,      // Impact scaling factor
  basePoints: number,      // Starting score
  rewards: Array<Reward>   // Unlockable perks
}
```

### Rewards Structure

```javascript
{
  id: number,
  name: string,
  cost: number,           // Points required to unlock
  icon: LucideIcon
}
```
